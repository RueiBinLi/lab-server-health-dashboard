# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists—it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**—read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

    /
    ├── CONTEXT.md
    ├── docs/adr/
    │   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
    │   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
    └── src/

Multi-context repo:

    /
    ├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
    ├── docs/adr/
    └── src/
        ├── ordering/
        │   ├── CONTEXT.md
        │   └── docs/adr/
        └── billing/
            ├── CONTEXT.md
            └── docs/adr/

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the required concept isn't in the glossary, reconsider whether the language belongs to the project or note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders)—but worth reopening because…_
